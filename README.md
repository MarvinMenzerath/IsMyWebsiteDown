# Is My Website Down?
**"Is My Website Down?" periodically Checks if your Websites are Reachable and Notifies you if one of them is not.**

## How IMWD Works
IMWD uses a simple Algorithm to Check your Websites in two steps:

1. **Fetch Content**: IMWD tries to get any Content from the Website. If this fails, IWMD tries to get content from http://google.com to check if there is a connection to the internet.
2. **Ping**: IWMD sends a few Pings to your Website to check if "only" the Webserver is down or the whole Server.
