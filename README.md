## How IMWD Works
IMWD has a simple routine and checks your websites in a few steps:

1. **Fetch content**: Tries to get any content from the website. If this fails, tries to get content from http://google.com to check if there is an connection to the internet.
2. **Ping**: Pings the website to check if "only" the webserver is down or the whole server.

## Download
If you only want to download and run IMWD, simply grab a current release from [here](https://github.com/MarvinMenzerath/IsMyWebsiteDown/releases) or heise.de:
